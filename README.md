# github-org-action-requester

Repository for managing request for GitHub Actions in a GitHub Organization. 

It works with [github-actions-allow-list-as-code-action](https://github.com/ActionsDesk/github-actions-allow-list-as-code-action) to update the allow list for GitHub Actions across a GitHub Org.
